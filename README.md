# PyScript

## PyScript is an open source platform for Python in the browser.

Using PyScript is as simple as:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
        <title>PyScript!</title>
        <link
            rel="stylesheet"
            href="https://pyscript.net/snapshots/2024.9.2/core.css"
        />
        <script
            type="module"
            src="https://pyscript.net/snapshots/2024.9.2/core.js"
        ></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Use MicroPython to evaluate some Python -->
        <script type="mpy" terminal>
            print("Hello, world!")
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

PyScript enables the creation of rich Python applications in the browser using
[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) (a version of
[CPython](https://python.org/)), [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/),
[WASM](https://webassembly.org/), and modern web technologies. It means Python
now runs anywhere a browser runs: desktop, laptop, mobile, tablet, or any other
browser enabled device.

To start building, read the
[Beginning PyScript tutorial](https://docs.pyscript.net/latest/beginning-pyscript/).

Every Tuesday at 15:30 UTC there is the _PyScript Community Call_ on zoom,
where we can talk about PyScript development in the open. Most of the
maintainers regularly participate in the call, and everybody is welcome to
join. This meeting is recorded and uploaded to our YouTube channel.

Every other Thursday at 16:00 UTC there is the _PyScript FUN_ call: the focus
of this call is to share fun projects, goofy hacks or clever uses of PyScript.
It's a supportive, energetic and entertaining meeting. This meeting is also
recorded and uploaded to our YouTube channel.
