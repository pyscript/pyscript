    Base class to write PyScript integration tests, based on playwright.

    It provides a simple API to generate HTML files and load them in

    It also provides a Pythonic API on top of playwright for the most
    common tasks; in particular:

      - self.console collects all the JS console.* messages. Look at the doc
        of ConsoleMessageCollection for more details.

      - self.check_errors() checks that no JS errors have been thrown

      - after each test, self.check_errors() is automatically run to ensure
        that no JS error passes uncaught.

      - self.wait_for_console waits until the specified message appears in the
        console

      - self.wait_for_pyscript waits until all the PyScript tags have been
        evaluated

      - self.pyscript_run is the main entry point for pyscript tests: it
        creates an HTML page to run the specified snippet.
