    THIS IS A WORKAROUND FOR A pytest QUIRK!

    At the moment of writing this conftest defines two new options, --dev and
    --no-fake-server, but because of how pytest works, they are available only
    if this is the "root conftest" for the test session.

    This means that if you are in the pyscriptjs directory:

    $ py.test                       # does NOT work
    $ py.test tests/integration/    # works

    This happens because there is also test py-unit directory, so in the first
    case the "root conftest" would be tests/conftest.py (which doesn't exist)
    instead of this.

    There are various workarounds, but for now we can just detect it and
    inform the user.
