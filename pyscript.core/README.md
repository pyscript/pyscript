# @pyscript/core - deprecated

After various discussions around this topic, we decided to avoid any confusion around this folder which never really belonged in here, as _core_ as we meant it was meant to be a _PyScript Next_ dependency, not the _PyScript Next_ itself.

We have hence moved and renamed _core_ as [polyscript](https://github.com/pyscript/polyscript/#readme) which is the base module to build up a better _PyScript Next_ without confusing our users or ourselves while talking about these two distinct projects.
