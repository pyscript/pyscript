# `version_info`

`PyScript.version_info` is a `namedtuple` representing the current version of PyScript. It can be used to compare whether current version precedes or follows a desired version. For a human-readable version of the same info, see [`__version__`](__version__.md)

```sh
>>> pyscript.version_info
version_info(year=2023, month=2, minor=1, releaselevel='dev')
```
