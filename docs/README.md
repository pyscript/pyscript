# PyScript documentation

Welcome to the PyScript documentation directory, where you can find
and contribute to discussions around PyScript and related topics.

## Getting started

Before you start contributing to the documentation, it's worthwhile to
take a look at the general contributing guidelines for the PyScript project. You can find these guidelines here
[Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Setup

The `docs` directory in the pyscript repository contains a
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) documentation project. Sphinx is a system
that takes plaintext files containing documentation written in Markdown, along with
and static files like templates and themes, to build the static end result.
