# PyScript documentation

Welcome to the PyScript documentation directory, where you can find
and contribute to discussions around PyScript and related topics.

## Getting started

Before you start contributing to the documentation, it's worthwhile to
take a look at the general contributing guidelines for the PyScript project. You can find these guidelines here
[Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Documentation Principles

The PyScript documentation is based on a documentation framework called [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/). This framework helps to solve the problem of structure in technical documentation and identifies four modes of documentation - **tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation**. Each one of these modes answers to a different user need, fulfills a different purpose and requires a different approach to its creation.

The picture below gives a good visual representation of that separation of concerns:

So, please keep that in mind when contributing to the project documentation. For more information on, make sure to check [their website](https://diataxis.fr/).

### Setup

The `docs` directory in the pyscript repository contains a
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) documentation project. Sphinx is a system
that takes plaintext files containing documentation written in Markdown, along with
static files like templates and themes, to build the static end result.

### Build

To learn how to build the docs, head over the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) page.
