# What is PyScript?

The PyScript library provides HTML tags for embedding and executing Python code in your browser. PyScript is built using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), the WebAssembly port of CPython, which is compiled using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

PyScript turns the browser into a code deployment tool that anyone can learn to use.

## Example

In this example, we are using the `<py-script>` HTML tag to generate a Matplotlib figure and display it as an image.
Click **Preview** to see the rendered HTML.

To try it in your browser, copy the code below into an online HTML editor like W3School's [Tryit Editor](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default_default), which allows you to modify, run, and even save your code. Watch the video below to see it in action!
