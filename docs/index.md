Welcome to the PyScript documentation!

PyScript provides a way for you to run Python code directly in your browser, giving
anyone the ability to program without infrastructure barriers. Add an interactive
Python REPL directly to your website, share an interactive dashboard with a colleague
as an HTML file, or create a client-side Python-powered web application. This documentation
will show you how.
