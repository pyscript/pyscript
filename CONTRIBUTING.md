# Code of Conduct

The [PyScript Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pyscript/governance/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) governs the project and everyone participating in it. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the maintainers or administrators as described in that document.

# Contributing

## Reporting bugs

Bugs are tracked on the [project issues page](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/issues). Please check if your issue has already been filed by someone else by searching the existing issues before filing a new one. Once your issue is filed, it will be triaged by another contributor or maintainer. If there are questions raised about your issue, please respond promptly.

## Creating useful issues

* Use a clear and descriptive title.
* Describe the specific steps that reproduce the problem with as many details as possible so that someone can verify the issue.
* Describe the behavior you observed, and the behavior you had expected.
* Include screenshots if they help make the issue clear.

## Reporting security issues

If you aren't confident that it is appropriate to submit a security issue using the above process, you can e-mail it to security@pyscript.net

## Asking questions

If you have questions about the project, using PyScript, or anything else, please ask in the [PyScript forum](https://community.anaconda.cloud/c/tech-topics/pyscript).

## Places to start

If you would like to contribute to PyScript, but you aren't sure where to begin, here are some suggestions.

* **Read over the existing documentation.** Are there things missing, or could they be clearer? Make some changes/additions to those documents.
* **Review the open issues.** Are they clear? Can you reproduce them? You can add comments, clarifications, or additions to those issues. If you think you have an idea of how to address the issue, submit a fix!
* **Look over the open pull requests.** Do you have comments or suggestions for the proposed changes? Add them.
* **Check out the examples.** Is there a use case that would be good to have sample code for? Create an example for it.

## Setting up your local environment and developing

If you would like to contribute to PyScript, you will need to set up a local development environment. The [following instructions](https://docs.pyscript.net/latest/development/setting-up-environment.html) will help you get started.

You can also read the [developing process](https://docs.pyscript.net/latest/development/developing.html) and how to rebase your branch with the latest changes.
