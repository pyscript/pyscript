# Code of Conduct

The [PyScript Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pyscript/governance/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) governs the project and everyone participating in it. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the maintainers or administrators as described in that document.

# Contributing

## Reporting bugs

Bugs are tracked on the [project issues page](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/issues). Please check if your issue has already been filed by someone else by searching the existing issues before filing a new one. Once your issue is filed, it will be triaged by another contributor or maintainer. If there are questions raised about your issue, please respond promptly.

## Creating useful issues

* Use a clear and descriptive title.
* Describe the specific steps that reproduce the problem with as many details as possible so that someone can verify the issue.
* Describe the behavior you observed, and the behavior you had expected.
* Include screenshots if they help make the issue clear.

## Reporting security issues

If you aren't confident that it is appropriate to submit a security issue using the above process, you can e-mail it to security@pyscript.net

## Asking questions

If you have questions about the project, using PyScript, or anything else, please ask in the [PyScript forum](https://community.anaconda.cloud/c/tech-topics/pyscript).

## Setting up your local environment

* Clone the repo using
```
    git clone https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript
```
* cd into the `pyscriptjs` folder using the line below in your terminal (if your terminal is already in pyscript then use **cd pyscriptjs** instead)
```
    cd pyscript/pyscriptjs
```
* Install the dependencies with the command below

```
    make setup
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **NOTE**: If `make setup` gives a node/npm version required  error then go to [troubleshooting](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

* You can also run the examples localy by running the command below in your terminal
```
    make examples
```
* Run ***npm run dev*** to build and run the dev server. This will also watch for changes and rebuild when a file is saved.
```
    npm run dev
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **NOTE**: To access your local build paste `http://localhost:8080` into your browser

* When you make changes locally, double check that your contribution follows the PyScript formatting rules by running `npm run lint`. Note that in this case you're looking for the errors, <u>**NOT**</u> the warnings (Unless the warning is created by a local change). If an error is found by lint you should fix it <u>**before**</u> creating a pull request


Now that node and npm have both been updated `make setup` should work, and you can continue [setting up your local environment](#setting-up-your-local-environment) without problems (hopefully).

## Places to start

If you would like to contribute to PyScript, but you aren't sure where to begin, here are some suggestions.

* **Read over the existing documentation.** Are there things missing, or could they be clearer? Make some changes/additions to those documents.
* **Review the open issues.** Are they clear? Can you reproduce them? You can add comments, clarifications, or additions to those issues. If you think you have an idea of how to address the issue, submit a fix!
* **Look over the open pull requests.** Do you have comments or suggestions for the proposed changes? Add them.
* **Check out the examples.** Is there a use case that would be good to have sample code for? Create an example for it.

# Submitting a change

All contributions must be licensed Apache 2.0, and all files must have a copy of the boilerplate license comment (can be copied from an existing file).

To create a change for PyScript, you can follow the process described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

* Fork a personal copy of the PyScript project.
* Make the changes you would like (don't forget to test them!)
* Please squash all commits for a change into a single commit (this can be done using "git rebase -i"). Do your best to have a well-formed commit message for the change.
* Open a pull request back to the PyScript project and address any comments/questions from the maintainers and other contributors.

## Becoming a maintainer

Contributors are invited to be maintainers of the project by demonstrating good decision making in their contributions, a commitment to the goals of the project, and consistent adherence to the [code of conduct](https://github.com/pyscript/governance/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).
